% Home for both new and old members of the Bay Area[^extended] Ops community.

The "Opsen" community is an invite-only group of individuals, centered in the Bay Area, focused on topics near and dear to work in the Ops side of technology.

## Ground rules

1.  This is a safe space. We need a place to vent, to speak freely, and this means no repeating or attributing sensitive information outside the group. *Don't talk about opsen in a public forum.*

1. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all. We operate under the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/conduct.html).

1.  If you want to invite someone to opsen
    *  You're an adult, you don't need to ask permission.
    *  You will be held responsible for them if they misbehave. This has happened multiple times, so don't take it lightly.
    *  Do you think that the person you are inviting is *interesting, a contributor, a good community member*, and/or *someone who needs this community*?
    *  You are encouraged to not invite people lightly; don't dilute the community.
    *  If you just want to bring a friend along once or twice, you don't have to baptize them into the mailing list, community, and slack. Just bring along a buddy, and introduce them.

1.  If you join opsen, send an intro.  If you invite someone to join opsen, *tell them these rules*, and *bug them to send an intro*.  It's your job to communicate this and remind them.  I feel like this is the main place we are failing: new people show up with no intro, there's no context, and over time this makes it feel like less of a community.

1.  Finally -- Expect an intro thread every year or so. Just to re-introduce ourselves to each other and see who's active as the group morphs and grows.
